      "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What are your guys' thoughts on who you're pulling for in Week 1, for personal or competitive/Rams reasons?</p> <p><strong>Saints</strong>: They're playing against a literal baseball team. Also they're expected to end with a top 3 draft pick, so seeing them win would potentially raise the floor of the worst team in the league, meaning a team that has a QB but fell on hard times for the year might end up with a draft pick we can trade up for more easily (if deemed necessary)</p> <p><strong>NOT Atlanta</strong>: Whoever they play, we basically have cheer for. Also, Bakermania can run all kinds of wild on them this week specifically. Outside of a competitive 49ers or Seahawks those weeks I will cheer against ATL all season. But if Seattle, for example, is out of playoff contention by their game, I'll at least get to say I'll be cheering for Cooper Kupp.</p> <p><strong>Commanders</strong>: Would love to keep cheering against Deebo, but I dislike Russell Wilson more to be honest. And Terry McLaurin alone deserves to have some continued success. I like that team, but I also see them as a threat so I'm not on the bandwagon but I would like to see them have a good game today.</p> <p><strong>Texans</strong>: I'd love to see them set a new record for times-sacked in a game. I like CJ Stroud and seeing him on pace after Week 1 to break a long standing record set by another Texans legend David Carr would be a really cool piece of history to witness after just one the first game! He only needs to be sacked 4.48 times today in order to get off to a hot start!</p> <p>Obviously, always cheering against the division rivals as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spam_Hand\"> /u/Spam_Hand </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesRams/comments/1naz4jb/teams_were_cheering_for_today_and_why/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesRams/comments/1naz4jb/teams_were_cheering_for_today_and_why/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Carter was ejected from the game before the first play from scrimmage of the entire 2025 NFL season because he spat on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. While some may argue that Prescott spat at the ground in a gesture towards Carter, the fact is that instead of having the foresight to see the opportunity of taking on a rookie guard in Tyler Booker, giving him a clean repeated shot at Prescott, he let his emotions take control and gave the Cowboys offense a clean pocket virtually all night.",

It's not hard to forecast that a healthy Christian McCaffrey is the big ingredient needed for a turnaround. But the 49ers did shake up the roster a bit and that also can reignite the fire of veteran holdovers. There is very little chance of San Francisco winning just 35 percent of its games for consecutive seasons after owning the division for multiple seasons.
